# SuperAdventure
An RPG project to improve programming skills with Visual Studio and C#

Ideas taken from [Scott Lilly's RPG Tutorial](http://scottlilly.com/learn-c-by-building-a-simple-rpg-index/)

## OOP Based RPG
This repository was created to improve C# programming practices and become more familiar with code refactoring and debugging.

## Classes used in the project (incomplete)
- Player
- Vendor
- Monster
- Location
- Quest
- Healing Potion
- Weapon

## What needs to be done:
- [X] Player goes to a location
- [X] Player may need an item required to enter location
- [X] Location may have a quest available
- [X] Player may need a certain item or items to complete a quest
- [X] Player uses weapons to fight monsters
- [X] Player can use a healing potion while fighting a monster
- [X] Player can acquire lootable items by fighting monsters at a location 
- [X] Player turns in items and receives rewards
- [X] Player can trade items the vendor wants
- [X] Player can only have one weapon and healing potion in inventory
- [X] Game saves player/vendor state to a file or database if available
* Save vendor data
- [X] Game loads player/vendor state from file or database if available
* Load vendor data

## Enhancements:
- [X] Add sounds during battle for when player/monster dies, attack hit/miss (based on weapon used)
